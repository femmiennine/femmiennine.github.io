      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>I am a Full-Stack Developer based in Stockholm, Sweden with a passion for Front-End Development especially responsive website design, and a firm believer in the mobile-first approach. With every line of code, I strive to make the web a beautiful place. I have a bachelor's degree in International Studies majoring in American Studies and a professional background in project & event management (6yrs), customer service(8yrs), and ESL teaching(3yrs).</p>
      <p>“Shape up or ship out”, said an internationally known Economist, Jagdish Bhagwati. It is something I learned from my International Political Economy subject back in college that really stuck on my mind to this day. Hence, when I came to Sweden 5 years ago, I was motivated to equip myself with new skills with the hope to succeed in changing my career path.</p>
      <p>In August 2019, I enrolled myself in Frontend Web Development, a Techdegree course program at Treehouse where I learned programming languages & tools. Also, I enrolled in Scrimba’s Frontend Career Path program with the intent to learn in-depth Javascript, React framework, and UI Design. All these while being pregnant, giving birth, and raising my now 2 yr old son. In November 2021, I started as a consultant at Klarna Bank AB, and 4 months later I managed to move to the case management team managing and developing Klarna's CRM used by their CS key users. Whilst enjoying and learning new things on the job such as automation and app development, and the 2nd-month review from managers going so well, I received the devastating news that I was one of the 700+ employees who were let go due to the economic downturn and company reorganization. Honestly, I was heartbroken, but life goes on.</p>
      <p>In order to keep up with the constantly evolving set of tools available to developers, I decided to apply to Integrify's Full Stack Developer program, and luckily I was accepted. I am continuously learning and refining my technical skills and have built projects throughout my coding journey, which you can access on my GitHub account.</p>
      <p>I am an independent learner who has repeatedly shown the ability to quickly utilize new concepts and technologies, enjoy sharing knowledge, prioritize high-value work daily, seek success for others through mentoring, and love to nurture a fun and inclusive work environment. Four things I’m looking for in my next job: a collaborative, team-focused culture, opportunities to learn and grow my skills from a technical standpoint, and a chance to learn more leadership skills over time.</p>
